   <h1>Hello there!</h1>
</div>
My name is Jovan and I am 16 years old! I have always been interested in technology and how they intergrate together. I have been coding since 2020 and have done some amazing projects in the process. I mostly write in Javascript and have worked with other langauges such as HTML, CSS and PHP.

<h2>Projects I have worked on</h2>

<h3>EVEE Bot (2020 - 2022)</h3>
EVEE Bot is a Discord Bot is a useful tool for users playing Disney Sourcers Arena. The bot is able to pull useful statistics about a character and much more! It also has real time information pulled from a backend API to allow users to keep up with the games information! (Unfortunately I am unable to disclose the code as this bot is still in production)

<h3>Sailboat (2021 - present)</h3>
Sailboat is a Discord Bot that helps Guilds to moderate their servers with ease. The bot stores infractions in the server and retrieves them from the database. There is a dashboard that is still work in progress that uses Discord Oauth to login.
